What exactly did you expect from a horror movie about nuns from a fairly unknown director?
This is literally best case scenario."

"'Immaculate' Review Thread : r/boxoffice","MrTeapott","Saw it last weekend.
It's decent, better than I expected it to be. Sydney is good in the film and it has moments that are more extreme than I would have thought.
Lots of predictable jump scares but a few moments that made me wince too.
It starts off a little earnest and then kinda veers into shlocky B-movie stuff at the end which was a lot of fun. Ending is pretty wild too.
We talking like hereditary wild? Or malignant off the rails schlock wild?
You had me at Shlocky B movie"

It might be gone and forgotten soon if audiences don’t show up but for a trashy movie in terms of quality, this is basically Malignant all over again."

"'Miller's Girl' review. A look into Jenna Ortega's new movie : r/Reviews","GeekyVoiceovers","Is it a revenge story? I don't like the movies that are romanticising these relationships and that trailer gave me a vibe between that as a revenge story
I should start out by admitting that I haven’t actually seen it yet.
From what I’ve read, it kind of is a revenge story. Cairo pines for Miller and pursues him relentlessly until she wears him down. At some point, Miller wants to end his sexual relationship with Cairo, but she’s pissed. She gets her short-lived revenge by reporting him to the principal, falsely claiming that Miller instigated the relationship. Eventually, Miller is vindicated."

"'Miller's Girl' review. A look into Jenna Ortega's new movie : r/Reviews","Unseentask","I liked it. The themes of self-discovery and preservation explored are interesting compared to something like the beekeeper which is just action with the theme of revenge which isn't that interesting (although I loved that movie too). Its the reason I loved Joker with the theme of alienation and Persepolis with the theme of misogyny. As a literature student I could analyze the movie finding out the hidden meaning and the reason for the choices the director made. Also I can't think of a scene in the movie that was pointless. Every scene had a purpose."

"2022 Ford Explorer Reviews : r/FordExplorer","RedWhiteAndJew","They’re almost always comparing the XLT trim with the 2.3 to the Hyundai Pallisade and Kia Telluride. The Hyundai and Kia have way more features that the XLT at a similar price point. If they were to compare higher trim the Ex would be more competitive"
"2022 Ford Explorer Reviews : r/FordExplorer","Time-Platform9330","Glad you're happy with your purchase!
Nice! I currently have a 2013 explorer that's been great for 10 years. Recently ordered a 22 timberline explorer.
Good point, I guess I'm in a different situation than most shopping for these vehicles. No kids but value the extra cargo space for hauling gear. Also need the towing and hate the look of most modern crossovers. Still appreciate nice acceleration and handling.
That's great to hear - I have a 22 timberline on order currently."
"2022 Ford Explorer Reviews : r/FordExplorer","Zealousideal_Yard270","I love my 21 ST. Great looking and fun to drive (now driving in eco mode with these gas prices). I had one issue within the first couple weeks, while parking front end down on a hill with low gas in the tank (<1/4 tank), the engine wouldn’t start due to the fuel pump location. Similar issues were reported on explorer threads…
All in all, a good 3rd row SUV. Hyundai and Kia models got a lot of press back in 2020. They seem to be more reliable vs the Hyundai and the Kia of the early 2000’s"

If you want all the candy probably telluride and pallaside are better options. They are all grocery getters I can’t see dropping more then 40k on any them. I have xlt love it and does the job with the candy I need.

"2022 Ford Explorer Reviews : r/FordExplorer","jawnnyboy","I think it’s really rare that someone who is shopping for a 3 row suv prioritizes acceleration, handling, and braking. Most people who buy in this segment probably wont even be looking at those metrics. Appearance is subjective. I’m not sure, but maybe the explorer is ranked low due to other issues like reliability?

Trading in our 2005 escape. No regrets"
"2022 Ford Explorer Reviews : r/FordExplorer","rltraylor","I've ordered the 4wd limited hybrid, build starts in July, did a lot of research and it was honestly between it and the Kia, the Kia's $7,000 to $15,000 over sticker is what settled it. plus I couldn't ""build"" the kia the way I wanted. Upgrading from a 2019 Edge for more room, seating etc., and the better mileage is a plus as well. Always good to hear positives to reinforce I've made the right decision."

The 4 runner was nice but up too high for my 87 yr old mom to get it plus I misread the carfax and the runner had been hit in the side. Gas mileage has already been enter just around rural areas."

The only problem with the show is actually remembering the characters. For example: My Hero Academia has a massive cast yet you can remember each one as they all stand out individually. Assassination Classroom just throws you all the students together and expects you to know all the students from the get go. Otherwise Assassination Classroom is a great show.
Can we just appreciate how the series subtly transforms from super, smiley and comedic to dark and serious? Absolutely fantastic anime.

I knew it wouldn't be a loud giant explosion right when it went off, that effect there was amazing, but I feel the earlier scenes of constant loud interruptions/effects near the beginning were too often and unnecessary.
That being said, the ending scene and dialogue gave me goosebumps and an existential crisis - so there's that.

It's an adaptation of the definitive Oppenheimer biography, American Prometheus (which won the Pulitzer Prize). The still living author of Prometheus, Kai Bird, raved about the film a few weeks ago.
It's not a documentary, but from those I know who read the book before seeing the film, despite the timeline structure Nolan hews very closely to depicting what's covered in the book."

Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the film is about how much the bomb program leader as a war&science hero suffered of being defamed a communist by scheming politicians.

At least that was my experience of studying at a top university in the 90s. This isn’t a new problem, and I hoped that it had got a little better by now."

His mom is pregnant with him in it. So technically?
A variant of the Spider-Therapist from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the villain, there are some visions of some of the main characters eventually becoming Spider-Women, and the third act features the birth of Peter Parker (with the film being set in 2003).

Also the battery is dying faster than what is advertised. Fully charged, the battery lasts just over 17 hours in load (gaming: Pokémon Go, which shouldn’t be that battery draining, text, call and other apps).
Shouldn’t the battery last over 20+ hours? It’s advertised as 29 hours with video playback
Dude samee!"
"My review of 15 pro : r/iphone","AppointmentNeat","Your battery life will obviously be better coming from and iPhone 12.
You got lucky on no overheating. Lots of people are experiencing overheating. So much so that Apple is set to release an update to address the overheating issue.
I actually have a new iPhone 12 pro. Mine got lost and I got a new one through the insurance. So it’s only 4 months old… battery capacity it 100% still.

"My review of 15 pro : r/iphone","iridako","The target audience for each new iPhone iteration is not the users with a device from the previous year. The focus is on: users of older iPhones, Android users, users of non-Pro iPhones who might be considering an upgrade and those who always want the latest device. Most people don’t upgrade every year. I think with the way the economy goes in many countries, most people won’t update every 2 years even. Apple generates enough revenue from the aforementioned user groups that they don’t need to dazzle the iPhone 14 users with the iPhone 15 and so on and so forth."

"My review of Percy Jackson, so far. : r/television","1Dominaj","Yes... but the thing is the orginal Percy Jackson book came out 18 years ago. The movies 13 years ago. So if you were 5-12 years old during the time of the movies and the end of the Last Olympian you would be in your late teens to early twenties now. You have to take into account that while Percy Jackson is a kid's book and kid's show, a lot of the fandom has grown up."

"My review of Percy Jackson, so far. : r/television","DigitalSetTheory","Everyone claiming these are children's books are idiotic. Percy Jackson is a YA novel with significantly more mature themes than the cat in the hat.

I like it so much more than five guys--their food is SO salty, greasy and expensive. I usually only eat fats food 1x per month but I have had the regular burger 3 times in the last month.

They'll simply pass that tax along to the consumer. If they start to think they're overtaxed they'll simply shut down and relocate the business to a new place, causing rampant unemployment, and all of the social problems that go along with unemployment.

"Should gyms ban filming?? : r/NoStupidQuestions","DoctorChu1307","My trainer films himself while doing exercises because he uses rather heavy weights and needs to check if his technique is right.

This type of filming for internal use doesn't require lots of takes and effort, so doesn't intrude on others.

Sometimes you gotta check your form and the mirrors only do so much (or you actively avoid them because they fuck up your form. Don’t stare at yourself when you’re doing squats and deadlifts).
I think the problem is more the conduct around filming than filming itself. Are you filming others without consent? Are you being obnoxious and taking up lots of space? These are problems. Respectfully filming yourself in the gym isn’t a problem."

There are often specialty gyms that people can patronize where this is common, but sometimes people have no other option than a commercial/chain facility where most people are not training for competitive reasons.
Based on the majority of the comments, this is not a commonly understood reason for filming in a gym."

"Should gyms ban filming?? : r/NoStupidQuestions","loverofnaps","Yes."
"Should gyms ban filming?? : r/NoStupidQuestions","lqxpl","Yes.
There are very few circumstances where your workout (ostensibly the whole fucking purpose of going to the gym) will be enhanced by filming yourself.
I'd argue the extremely common circumstance of checking your own form very much enhances your workout. The mirror can't cut it when you're lifting anything heavy since it's hard to look up at it and the head on angle doesn't show a lot.
This is just not true. It’s the only way people who train alone can assess their efforts."
"Should gyms ban filming?? : r/NoStupidQuestions","luckoftheirish53","I think it depends on the filming. I used to put my phone on the ground and film fully aware that someone could walk by it. The moment you bring in a tripod that’s when you cross the line"

"Should gyms ban filming?? : r/NoStupidQuestions","moosecakems","No, there are two sides to filming, one is people watching their own form to improve technique, this is important. The second is influencers, their channels thrive on the drama and glamor, I draw this distinction, if it can be proven they're causing drama for views in the gym, they get banned permanently from the gym, if they are just modeling, no harm no foul, most of us lift for some aesthetic reason or another and going online with the results is harmless ."
